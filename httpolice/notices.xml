<!--

The vocabulary here should mostly be obvious after studying some examples.
See also :mod:`httpolice.notice`.

One non-obvious thing is how references work
(i.e. the mousover highlights in HTML reports):

- Constants marked up with elements like ``<h/>`` and ``<st/>``
  are magically highlighted where they appear in the corresponding message(s)
  (see :func:`httpolice.reports.html._magic_references` for details).
  For example, if a notice includes ``<st>401</st>``
  and appears in a response whose status code is 401,
  then hovering the mouse on the notice will highlight the status code.
  Sometimes you need to disable this with a ``ref="no"`` attribute.

- Anything referenced by a ``<var/>`` element is magically highlighted.

- If you want to highlight something else,
  add an explicit ``<ref/>`` element at the end of the ``<notice/>``.
